## Introduction
This project simulates Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF). [Specifically, it simulates charged particles and their trajectories in Î² and e fields.]?
- Setup particles for MagLIF
    - Two sets of plasmas
        - 1. Low density plasma cylinder
        - 2. High density thin cylindrical shell around plasma cylinder.
- Setup external fields. 
    - Electric field along the cylinder.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
